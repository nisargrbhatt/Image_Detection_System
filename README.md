# Image_Detection_System
This System is based on oopencv and tenserflow concepts.
The System will start using camera module and identify the objects using pre-trained Neural Network (Courtacy to "PyImageSearch").

#To start the System:
python image_detection.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model
